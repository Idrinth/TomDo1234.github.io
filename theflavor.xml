            Out of the approximately 2791741.5 species of fish (Yes... there are several half-fishes), thousands of them are attracted
            to blood. Blood is good bait but it can be dangerous to have carnivorous animals know where you are.
            Blood Spear Fishing' is like a fishing-martial-art that makes using Blood safe in fishing. <![CDATA[<br/>]]><![CDATA[<br/>]]>

        <flavor>
            The Whetfish is a very common species, many can find it... few can use it. The magical scales and saliva of the fish can either
            harden solids or empower other magical sources. As you can already tell it is used to make weapons stronger
            ,hence its name which is derived from the 'whetstone' (And yes... the picture in the icon is an annotated
            Diagram of the fish). <![CDATA[<br/>]]><![CDATA[<br/>]]>

            Unlike Knights, Generic Swordsman are not trained how to track game. They are instead trained for armed combat. Coming from mediocre
